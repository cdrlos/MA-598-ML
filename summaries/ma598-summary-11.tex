\noindent \textbf{Title of paper:} Targeted Backdoor Attacks on Deep Learning
Systems Using Data Poisoning.

\noindent\textbf{What is their primary result?} The authors show that it
can be difficult to detect and defend against several types of backdoor
poisoning attacks.

\noindent\textbf{Why is this important?} This research is important
because as machine learning becomes more intertwined with human lives, their
reliability and vulnerabilities become increasingly important.

\noindent\textbf{What are their key ideas?}

\noindent\textbf{What are the limitations, either in performance or
  applicability?}

\noindent\textbf{What might be an interesting next step based on this work?}

\noindent\textbf{What's the architecture?}

\noindent\textbf{How did they train and evaluate it?}

\noindent\textbf{Did they implement something?}
